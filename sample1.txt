We bridge the skills gap in technology and other high-demand disciplines by connecting education to the working world. Aligned to industry, our Academy curriculum adapts to meet ever-changing requirements. 

Our Alumni offering focuses on custom-trained emerging talent. Through the hire-train-deploy model, we place outstanding graduates into a client’s team for 12 to 24 months, after which they can be converted to full-time employees at no extra cost. At the end of the program, ninety percent of Alumni stay on under our clients’ permanent headcount. 

In our Reskill offering, we create custom training for employees, enabling clients to retain valuable organizational knowledge while evolving along with the industry landscape.
